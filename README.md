### The Scope Plane

It is a multiple choice quiz layout, the user must choose one option. The quiz will assess correct and incorrect answers and give the user this feedback.

Potential future releases could include the addition of reasons behind the correct answer being correct and a timer feature so that the user has to manage their time like a real exam. The test could be broken down further into specific modules that the student could choose what to be tested on.
